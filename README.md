Most of the work is done by this github "https://github.com/Hridai/Automating_Outlook/blob/master/ol_script.py" and is definetely worth the read.

I wanted to iterate email for headers. Such as '!!' 'emergency'.

While using this beware of not being to use outlook. Outlook updates running causing program to not run. Closing outlook crashes the program.
